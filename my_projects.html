                While you can find most of my finished projects on Youtube and Soundcloud, I'd like to dedicate this section of the page towards some projects I'm particularly proud of or would otherwise like to highlight and share some extra thoughts on, especially concerning the creative process. If you want to learn more about the resources I use for my projects, go take a look at my Links and Resources page!

                        Fairy Tale is my current best work compositionally and harmonically speaking for now. The piano in the video isn't recorded live, this is my first publically released work where I used my current favorite piano sample library, Embertone's <a href="https://www.embertone.com/instruments/concertD.php">1955 Walker Concert D (lite)</a>. I recorded my performance using an 88 key MIDI keyboard connected via MIDI to USB to FL Studio, used the best takes and edited it, mostly due to sustain pedal delay issues. I also wrote the sheet music for it, and if you would like it please contact me personally.

                        Bittersweet Memories is my current best released work using sample libraries, in this case BBCSO discover, although this will definitely change in the future. I also used the free Steinway D in FLEX's Piano Essentials which came with several disadvantages involving sustain pedal information which is why the piano may sound weird, aside from my horrendous attempt at mixing the climax of the song. The Mario Galaxy inspired synth is a simple Vital patch I made.
                    <p>
                        I really need to figure out how to mix the high mids of pianos in order to not make resonant frequencies hurt/distort on less capable systems such as phone speakers. My guess is that it involves putting a lot more work into (multiband?) compression than I do at the moment. I'm also flirting with the thought of using soothe 2-like spectral compression pluigns, although it feels like cheating/overkill.

                    <p>
                        My personal dilemma with mixing/mastering is the longer I metaphorically bang my head against the wall attempting to polish them, the more dissatisfied I become with the end result and the less likely I become to call the track finished and release it. There is also no written symphonic orchestral score for this, because I have no clue how to do that.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Finally, this is currently my only work where I have also made my own artwork for the cover, which was originally because I wanted to put the track on Spotify, but my general distaste for Spotify and distributors has only kept growing and I will absolutely use it to justify not putting it on there.
