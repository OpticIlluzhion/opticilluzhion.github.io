            Hi, I'm Optic!

        <p>
            Welcome to my 6th(?) attempt at making my own website (I lost count over the years)

            Why does this site exist?
        </h2>
        <p>
            To put it simply, websites feel like the rawest and most genuine possible form of modern internet self expression. Yes, social media exists, yes, content management systems like Squarespace exist and yes, they can make things look very modern and pretty, but a few months ago (at the time of writing) I stumbled upon the website of <a href="https://nurykabe.com/">Yann Vann der Cruyssen</a>, the composer of the soundtrack for Stray, and nothing beat the feeling of that.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's a very bare bones website, seemingly purely HTML upon first glance, yet there was more personality in it than any social media page could ever offer. I spent hours on it, trawling through all of the insane amount of small and large projects this man had undertaken. He had done everything from audio to video to programming tools to books to games and much, much more. It was humbling, inspiring, and incredibly interesting to see a uniquely unfiltered view of what I consider to be a truly creative man.
        </p>
        <p>
            Just two months later I would discover <a href="https://neocities.org/">neocities</a>, and I instantly fell in love with it and the websites I saw on it. Every site I browsed through looked like a personally crafted and designed labor of love, as opposed to an algorithmically fuelled, highly manufactured view of someone's social life, or a completely ad-filled, tracker-infested, possibly AI generated, sickening, slow mess of a website that was SEO-ed to death by people corrupted by profit and data brokers. Rant aside, as someone who is still learning the ropes of HTML/CSS, I was very impressed with the sheer creativity on neocities. I wanted to be part of this. So here I am, and I hope I can give you the same feeling as I got when I came across Yann's website. Even if mine has a lot less personality because I like modern web design too much to make it look like an actual neocities website.

            Put my site up on neocities! This site is under construction and I really hope I can stay motivated to keep working on it and redesigning it the more I learn about web dev
