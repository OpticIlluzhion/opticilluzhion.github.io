            <h1>On Giving Advice</h1>
<p id="date">22/01/25</p>
<p>One of the most ubiquitous pieces of advice one encounters, or at least in the English-speaking parts of the world, is to love oneself. To some, this may feel like a fact so obvious it shouldn’t even need to be said. To others, especially among those of us who do not, cannot or do not know how to love themselves, there is a wide spectrum of possible reactions. These range from people who are curious or want to learn how to do so, to complete rejection of the notion of self love for a plethora of different reasons such as self hatred, a lack of understanding of what it means, social or cultural reasons, the list, as it so often does, goes on.</p>
<p>Personally, I have found that I’m someone who becomes very skeptical when presented with advice that does not get sufficiently elaborated upon. “Love yourself” was one of those pieces of advice for me. Upon asking the all-too common follow up question of “but how though?” I would be told by a few different people to simply habitually repeat to myself that I love myself, either in my head or out loud in front of the mirror.</p>
<p>Clearly this must have worked for many people, since in my experience this is quite a common response, but it did not sit well at all with my absolutely relentless inner critic. My immediate reaction was that there could be no larger sin in the world than repeatedly lying to myself. I could not even bring myself to say it mentally without immediate feelings of revulsion or discomfort. Hence, I rejected self love, and went back to stewing in my pit of low self esteem. This led me to the belief that self love could be nothing but a thin facade for ego-fueled, delusional narcissism, borne of habitual acts of mental masturbation.</p>
<p>My perspective on self love, though, has changed a lot in the meantime. This was in large part thanks to discovering psychoeducational videos which provided me with a much deeper understanding of how I function as a person, neatly packaged with an added dimension of self awareness. This new information eventually led me on an upwards spiral, on which I have found self acceptance and higher self esteem. I still don’t think I can say I love myself yet, however here is how I would explain the idea of self love now.</p>
<p>As humans, we have something known as metacognition, or to oversimplify, the ability to be self aware. As we are aware of ourselves, we are able to think about ourselves and form opinions about ourselves, which means we are in some sort of relationship with ourselves. Similar to external relationships, we are able to either nurture or harm our own relationship with ourselves. Unlike external relationships, however, we are essentially stuck with ourselves until death. For some people, this royally sucks. Imagine this internal relationship being an abusive one, where you are both the abuser and the victim, both receiving the pain and justifying it to yourself by saying you deserve it, thus perpetuating your own internal cycle of abuse. Maybe some of you reading this don’t have to imagine that. I’ve witnessed it and experienced it personally to some degree. It’s not pretty.</p>
<p> However, things clearly don’t have to be this way<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>, and this is where I contrast this life of abuse with the idea of self love. Self love is treating yourself like you would treat a loving long-term partner, one that you’ve known for however many years you’ve lived. This is someone you know inside and out, someone who is deeply flawed but who you wholly accept as such. This is someone who deeply values your opinion, while not being afraid of respectfully being honest with you when you’re doing something that they don’t like. They are willing to learn and grow alongside you as well as support you, take care of you when you need it and hold you accountable on your own personal journey. Conversely, they also know you inside and out, you’re also deeply flawed, and so on. I hope it becomes obvious how having this kind of relationship with yourself is a much better and sustainable way to live with yourself until your deathbed than habitually mentally whipping yourself right where you know it hurts “for motivation” or “because I deserve it”.<br>
I speak from personal experience here, by the way. You may gaslight yourself into thinking you’ll stop if you reach some arbitrary goal or change something about yourself, but the goalposts always shift, and the stop sneakily becomes nothing but a short break.</p>
<p>If the idea of self love were to be presented to my past self in this way, not only do I think I would be more receptive to it, but it would give me a much clearer idea of what it is and as a bonus, it would also serve as a great explanation for the saying that one must love oneself before loving someone else. The reason I’m sharing this story, though, is not because I’m hoping to change or deepen anyone’s perspective on self love. If it does, that’s great, but ultimately I would like to take a step further and share a few broader general points and insights about advice in general that I have gleaned from this experience.</p>
<p>The first insight is that technically, the advice hasn’t changed at all. What actually changed was the way it was communicated, the time and therefore life situation at which it was communicated and the person communicating it (or in this case, me figuring it out largely by myself years later). Now, keeping all of this in mind, here’s an interesting question. Why did nobody ever explain self love to me in this way?</p>
<p>Well, if we apply Occam’s Razor, I think one of the most likely explanations is that self love made intuitive sense<sup id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup> to the people giving the advice. They’ve never had to have it explained to them in thorough detail for it to make sense, so they couldn’t just conjure up a well thought out, compelling pre-prepared lecture about self love with batteries included out of nothing. This is the explanation I’m the most sympathetic to.</p>
<p>A second possible explanation could be that the advice giver is of the belief that their personal interpretation of the advice isn’t something that should be imposed upon anyone. Rather, the idea is that one should discover by themselves what the advice means. While I can appreciate the general sentiment behind this, and even though it did end up working out fine for me despite my own initial struggles, I think it is worthwhile to keep in mind that not everyone is as fortunate as I was. In fact, I would be willing to bet that there may be several millions of people who, by pure nature of the vagueness of the advice and their life situation, run the risk of never reaching the point that I did - they may never redefine self love in a more positive light. This issue goes well beyond self love, of course, but I think it is a compelling example that illustrates the potential dangers of giving vague advice to people who may not be in the right place, time or mindset to receive it.</p>
<p>There’s one more thing that I would like to touch on regarding this belief, and that is that this line of thinking runs directly counter to my personal understanding of how the field of philosophy operates. In philosophy (once again from my personal understanding) students, enthusiasts and philosophers are routinely exposed to several interpretations of the same topics as argued by other philosophers. This does not at all impede anyone from performing their own analysis and forming their own opinions. In fact, I’m compelled to think that it only encourages forming the skills to perform a more robust analysis of the topic at hand, as you are made much more keenly aware of all of the possible logical pitfalls, traps and biases you might have fallen victim to.</p>
<p>Not everyone is a thinker who is open to sitting through an entire philosophy lecture, therapy session or thinly veiled monologue-rant when it comes to being given advice, though. Some may consider it inefficient or kind of unnecessary at best and outright patronizing, condescending, frustrating or boring at worst. They might be in a position where they yearn for nothing but simple, clear answers which might not cover all of the small nuances and complications but are good enough in their mind. In fact, this would be a third compelling explanation as to why the average advice giver (who also usually happens to be a somewhat average person, assuming West European or North American cultural norms) might not go into that level of detail. This, along with the fact that we live in an increasingly fast moving world which is already being relentlessly inundated by information combined with ever dwindling attention spans, does make a case for summarizing information as much as possible.</p>
<p>At this point, we reach the mind blowing and terribly unfortunate conclusion that not everyone is like me, and that what I would consider to be good and well communicated advice does not at all work for everyone. Some people only have the time or mental space for the short version, and they want it delivered clearly, confidently, and in some cases loudly enough to drown out their thoughts, as well as those pesky “well, actually”s from the philosophy majors.<br>
I have a strong suspicion that this is one of the reasons why we have a multi-billion dollar self help industry, not to mention the boatloads of inspirational or motivational videos that you can find online. It’s not about the advice or the motivation itself, it’s about the search for the person who can make it finally “click” at the right moment, much like the one you would experience after finally figuring out a math problem after toiling on it for a long time. It’s about attacking the same advice from several different angles and perspectives, not unlike the philosophical approach, but in a much more condensed, palatable and arguably very capitalistic way, with rigorous analysis likely being left either as a mere afterthought or as an uncommunicated exercise for the motivated reader<sup id="fnref3"><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup></p>
<p>Thus far, I have discussed the importance and nuances surrounding the complex issue of communicating and interpreting advice. However, there is one large question that remains: what is “good” advice?<br>
As you can probably imagine by this point, that is not exactly an easy question to answer. After all, I have essentially spent the past (almost) 1800 words describing just how easy it is for even “common” wisdom and advice to be miscommunicated or misunderstood (or delivered by the wrong person, and so on and so forth). What complicates things further is that I think a lot of us are likely much worse judges of what good advice is than we might think, as we are mostly slaves to our own personal experience, perception and intuition.</p>
<p>If I was held at gunpoint and asked to give an answer, though, here’s what my completely unqualified ideas as to what constitutes good advice might look like. To simplify things, we will be assuming an ideal world in which there is perfect communication, we live in a frictionless vacuum and the cows are nice and spherical.</p>
<p>The first and most important component of good advice is that it must fit the situation and context at hand. In other words, there must first not only be a good understanding of what the situation or issue of the advice seeker is, but also a good understanding of whatever other important (mental, physical, emotional etc.) context exists around it. To give a concrete example of lacking important context, “ask your parents” is not advice you would want to find yourself (hopefully accidentally) giving to an orphan. Another example of bad advice would be to tell a homeless person to simply buy a house. This demonstrates a clear lack of a good understanding of both the situation and the context. These are both very clear, straightforward examples, however it is almost impossible to understate how easy it is to miss, forget or be fully unaware of an important detail or to think you fully understand a situation that you really do not - that is, unless you study or work in a field where you are routinely exposed to the sometimes fatal consequences of not considering the details while performing a diagnosis or analysis.</p>
<p>The second and much more tricky to define component of good advice is that it seeks to aim towards the best realistically achievable or desirable outcome, given the restrictions defined by the first component and by priorities<sup id="fnref4"><a href="#fn4">4</a></sup>. Ideally, this would be a solution which works well both short term and long term and comes with minimal to no negative side effects or compromises. Unfortunately, such solutions generally tend to firmly reside in frictionless spherical cow land, far away from what is realistically achievable.<br>
Now let’s compare this to the case of a drug addict suffering an overdose. I bring this up to highlight two things. First of all, short term advice (get them into the ER) and long term advice (situation dependent) will look very different, although both can be very valuable. Second of all, whether long term advice or short term band-aid solutions are preferable also depends on the highest current priority, which in this case would be survival. Surely nobody would look at someone who’s in the middle of an overdose, give them a finger wag, say “you should stop taking drugs” and then attempt to justify their advice by exclaiming “long term advice is always better!”. Of course, there is always more nuance to explore and discuss, but we have officially reached the point where I, too, will leave that as an exercise for the motivated reader.</p>
<p>Ultimately, although I personally do find it interesting to think and write about the intricacies of the topics of advice and communication, it may not really matter all that much. I do not think there is much advice or information that can fully substitute the type of depth of learning and understanding that can only be gained by lived personal experience and reflection. I do find myself wishing, though, that more people would be more acutely aware of the many challenges that come with choosing, communicating and receiving advice, and that is what this Thought Dump hopes to achieve. Awareness, after all, is the first step to learning<sup id="fnref5"><a href="#fn5">5</a></sup>, including learning how to maybe, possibly, eventually, hopefully, give better advice.</p>

                <p>Here I was debating whether I should include something along the lines of “after all, you get to dictate what your relationship towards yourself is”. I decided against it ultimately, since even ignoring the philosophical question of whether you are in control of yourself, this would be far too close to invalidating phrases such as “it’s all in your head” for comfort. <a href="#fnref1">↩</a></p>

                    I think this is a great example of how intuition can paradoxically become a barrier to deeper understanding. If you don’t need deeper understanding that’s fine, but your intuition will be very difficult to explain to people whose intuition tells them the opposite thing. <a href="#fnref2">↩</a></p>

                    To be completely clear, this is not meant to be read as me purely bashing the self help industry. I am a firm believer of the best workout being the one that <em>consistently</em> gets you off of the couch (as opposed to the most “theoretically optimal” one), and my personal view of good advice is analogous to that - whatever works best for you, works best for you. <a href="#fnref3">↩</a></p>

                    If this sounds like vague, complex word salad, it’s because it is and I overthought it. I’m still not entirely sure to what exact degree I agree with my own definition. I could be extremely annoying to myself and complain about little nuances like the implications of the wording of “seeks to aim”, but I’ve decided to settle on this because it’s complicated and situational and probably good enough for now <a href="#fnref4">↩</a></p>

                    At least, assuming you don’t intentionally ignore, deny or reject the information, of course, that’s another can of worms that I’ve decided against going into further <a href="#fnref5">↩</a></p>
