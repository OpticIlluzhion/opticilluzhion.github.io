        <p>
            I go by Optic online mainly, although my real name is Alex. Regarding pronouns etc. for those who are interested in that sort of thing I go by he/him - the defaults seem to be working properly for me, at least when it comes to gender. I am owned by two cats, Void and Frodo, whom I am legally obligated to call the cutest and best boys. Because they are. I aspire to be a soundtrack composer for games and am applying for a degree in composition at the time of writing. I can speak, read and write in five languages (English, Spanish, Italian, German and French), although English is the only language I can say I'm truly comfortable in. Ultimately, technically this entire website is about me, so I've decided to keep this section relatively short.

            I've had a large variety of interests and hobbies growing up, although the ones that have stuck with me to this day are:
        </p>
        
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Music (listening, producing, composing, performing, jamming, sound design)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Chess (see my <a href="https://www.chess.com/member/optic_illuzhion">chess.com</a> and <a href="https://lichess.org/@/matent">lichess</a> profiles)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Math, or at least the part of it which you can apply to physics, engineering, statistics and/or software development
                </li>
                <li>
                    Programming and automation (I'm currently writing a file management app in Python, planning to write MIDI scripts to automate some aspects of music production and learning C++ to hopefully contribute to MuseScore some time in the future)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Front end web dev
                </li>
                <li>
                    Psychology and mental health
                </li>
                <li>
                    Video essays
                </li>
            </ul>
