        <p>
            Hi, my name is Alex, although I mainly go by Optic online. Regarding pronouns etc. for those who are interested in that sort of thing, I'm the most basic he/him cishet white guy you can possibly get - the defaults seem to be working properly for me, barring the side dish of autism. I'm 20, born in Spain to parents who spoke English and German to me, but then we moved to Italy for three years and finally ended up in Switzerland, where I still live to this day. As a result of this, I can speak, read and write semi-fluently in five languages: English, German, Spanish, Italian and French (Swiss German doesn't count because I said so), although I'm most comfortable with English. I am owned by two cats, Frodo and Void, whom I am legally obligated to call the cutest and best boys. Because they are.
