            Thought Dump
        </h1>

    <p>
        In which I occasionally dump my thoughts on various topics in varying degrees of quality that have been churning around in my head for many years with a writing style in a state of constant identity crisis. This is due to me having deluded myself into thinking that my thoughts on topics that have been discussed uncountable times by uncountable people, many of whom being much more qualified, thoughtful and eloquent than myself, may still be interesting to read for some people. One would think that self awareness about this delusion would remedy this, and yet it has not, and here we are. I suspect it's either an autism thing or an ego thing. After all, someone without an ego wouldn't spend a dozen or so hours learning HTML, CSS, JS, VSCode and Github just to make a website completely about themselves.
