    <title>(Slightly Belated) March 2025 Update</title>

    <description>
      Slightly belated March update, I have now officially started working on RSS feeds! Also, I now have a robots.txt file to (theoretically) prevent AI company crawlers from scraping my website, there's a new Monthly Project and a new Website Plans section on my <a href="my_projects.html">projects page</a>. Fixed the bluesky link and added my logo as the website's icon

    <title>February 2025 Update</title>

    <description>
      I bought my own domain now!! Updated the My Projects page to include the OST I'm working on, the first Monthly Project (Iberialism) has officially started and I have updated the list of projects I plan to work on. The About Me page styling should look slightly better now but the gradient text bug still happens on mobile because styling for mobile is just... pain

    <title>The Website Has Gone Live!</title>

        The website is finally live! This should have happened approximately six days ago, however writing the first Thought Dump as well as everything around it website wise took way longer than expected and I'm very not happy with how things look like in terms of the current workflow... eh, sounds like a problem for future me
